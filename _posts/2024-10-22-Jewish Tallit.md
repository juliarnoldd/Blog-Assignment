In Judaism, there are many objects that hold great importance in ritual practice. One of these material objects is the Tallit, a four cornered prayer shawl worn during prayer. This ritual garment is square or rectangle in shape, and has tasseled fringe suspending from each of its four corners known as the tzitzit. These tassels are of great significance as they fulfill the commandments of Numbers 15.37-40, 

> “The Lord said to Moses as follows: Speak to the Israelite people and instruct them to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout the ages... That shall be your fringe; look at it and recall all the commandments of the Lord and observe them... Thus you shall remember all My commandments and to be holy to your God. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God.” 

Looking at these fringes, those of the Jewish faith are to remember God Who brought them forth and ordained them to a life of holiness. When these fringes are tied during ritual practice, they produce wholeness, unity, connection and sacredness.

Historically, the Tallit has been worn only by men. However, since 1887, a change was initiated among the Conservative synagogues by embracing modernity and increasing gender equality. Eventually, this change allowed women to also start wrapping themselves in the tallit for ritual practices. In doing so, women, like men, connect to their spirituality by imitating God Himself who prays wrapped in the tallit of light according to the Talmud. By taking shelter under the tallit, one is symbolically taking shelter under God’s wings.

Even Further, the tallit is connected to important rites of passage in Jewish communities. In Conservative synagogues, boys and girls become responsible for their direct relationship with God and experience a change in status on the Bar and Bat Mitzvah when they receive their tallit. This change in status represents their transition from minor to adult in the synagogue, with their tallit signifying their newfound inclusion in the required ten for minyan, and their newfound participation in the religious community. 

Consequently, the tallit’s significance does not stop there. The garment is also connected to life-cycle events, such as weddings or ceremonies where the bride and groom will stand under the tallit as it serves the function of a chuppah, or canopy that symbolizes the union of two people. It is also a traditional practice to wrap the body of a Jew with their tallit upon death, however one must first cut the fringes off of one corner of the garment. When the tallit is wrapped around a dead body in such a way, it signifies that it is no longer viable and whole. When the fringes are cut, the social relations of the deceased are also severed, along with their ability to follow God’s commandments laid out in Numbers 15.
